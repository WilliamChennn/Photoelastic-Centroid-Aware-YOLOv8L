# Photoelastic-Centroid-Aware-YOLOv8L
YOLOv8-L based centroid detection in photoelastic granular flows on inclined surfaces
This project implements a centroid detection system for photoelastic granular flows on inclined surfaces using the YOLOv8-L model with transfer learning. The goal is to accurately detect and track particle centroids and radii from experimental images to support further granular flow analysis.
